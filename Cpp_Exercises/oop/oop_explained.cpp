/*syntax to declare a class its good practice to put c before your class name,
since its going to be generic so people can copy syntax for everything explained in the lectures from it
I am gonna call it cClass XD not to confuse people at all :D
its the same as struct in c but u can add functions in it now its called methods and a lot of other things
gonna come one by one later also struct here is the same as a class just that everything in struct is public
by default while everything in class is private by default.
also i got no idea what public and private do in actual work setting and practice but the academic explanation is:
if it got public: before it anyone can modify it from outside the class,
if it got private: before it you can't modify it from outside the class but u can modify it with methods from inside
the class until you use friend before method now u can modify private data from outside the class xD
there is only one edge case for the use of friend keyword which if u want to have some other type on the lhs
of ur overloaded operator since in normal overloading always the obj is on lhs so to have something like int or float
on lhs u have to use friend method i think not sure or maybe declare global function*/

    i know templates complicates things normally this would look like:

    cClass obj;

    much cleaner :D

    now back to constructors simply its the method that get called when you create a new object from class
    if u didn't make one the compiler will call default one that does nothing and u get garbage in your members

so lets explain the inheritance keywords
like public,private,protected
so as explained to us private is the strongest it can pretty much overwrite the other two
so if inherit with the keyword private all the methods and members i inherited from parent class
become private in my child class.
--so in simple terms if i write private i get everything except private from parent but it all becomes private in child class
--lets call them variables for now instead of members for ease of explanation since we all come from c background
if my parent class got private variable and protected variable and public variable
writing private when inheriting the private variable gonna stay private in parent class i can't access it in
child class at all but the protected variable gonna convert to private in child class so i can access it only
from inside the child class and the public from parent gonna convert to private also in child class
that is why private is the strongest word then comes protected then comes public*/

/*long explanation above
 هنا الخلاصه

private is the strongest can modify everything
inheriting with "private" keyword   >>parent "private"   stays     "private"    can't access it in child class.
                                    >>parent "protected" becomes   "private"    in child class.
                                    >>parent "public"    becomes   "private"    in child class.

protected is strong kinda can only modify public
inheriting with "protected" keyword >>parent "private"    stays    "private"     can't access it in child class.
                                    >>parent "protected"  stays    "protected"   in child class.
                                    >>parent "public"     becomes  "protected"   in child class.

public is weak does nothing can't modify anything best one just inherit it as is
inheriting with "public" keyword    >>parent "private"    stays    "private"     can't access it in child class.
                                    >>parent "protected"  stays    "protected"   in child class.
                                    >>parent "public"     stays    "public"      in child class.

best one is inheriting public just everything stays the same :D


btw protected can't be accessed outside its class unless i inherit it then i can use it in the child class
private on the other hand can't be accessed outside its class at all like ever unless that "friend" thing comes along and ruins everything.
